# Vibemaxing-In-Space
A Vibe Coding experiement, based on Space Station 13

## Notes
~~* Made using Claude 3.7 Max in Cursor (minimum $.05 per call)~~
* Every release after 33.2.5 is using Gemini 2.5 Max (Same minimum cost)
* I am making branches at price points to track progress.

### Releases
* These are worded by dollar amounts. i.e. release/xx.y.z is equivalent to $xx.yz 
* This represents how much had been paid for cluade to get to that point. 
* Current Releases:
  * release 2.5.0 - Basic Stock Market fuctionality, basic navigation, robust error handling.
    * ~$.80 for the room app.
    * ~$.40 for the room navigation.
    * ~$.20 for the stock market refactor from something I had.
    * The rest is bug fixes for the above
  * release 5.0.5 - Adding rooms to the station, as well as funcationality to the rooms, and new roles
    * ~$1.05 to get the room working
    * ~.20 for getting the roles implemented
    * ~.30 for adding funcationality of roles to rooms
    * The rest is bug fixes
  * release 8.4.5 - Added engineering bay, limb based health system, ability to heal in medbay, and a bunch of random events in the hallway
    * Don't remember much of the breakdown
    * ~$.75 I do remember for the notes system
    * Other then some UI issues, there was not many bug fixes
  * release 10.3.0 - Added .exe build, and the ability to read the books in your locker
    * ~$1.10 for doing the .exe build, and to remove the linux builder I didn't ask for
    * The rest was some minor bug fixes and adding the read ability.
  * release 16.9.5 - Added 2 new roles: Head of Personnel and Botanist. Added new stations. Also added drink mixing. 
    * The average prompt is now costing ~$0.25, instead of ~$.15 per prompt for any non-minor change.
  * release 33.2.5 - Added new damage types(no med changes yet), added engineering power functionality, added basic atmospherics
    * This release was painful. Everything up to release 32 was 10% me prompting, 85% Claude messing up, and 5% me trying to fix
    * As a test, I tried Gemini 2.5 Max. 
    * I was able to fix everything within 2 prompts
    * Gemini 2.5 Max is primiary from here on out

# Vibemaxing-In-Space
A Vibe Coding experiement, based on SS13

## Notes
* Made using Claude 3.7 Max in Cursor (minimum $.05 per call)
* I am making branches at price points to track progress.

### Releases
* These are worded by dollar amounts. i.e. release/xx.y.z is equivalent to $xx.yz 
* This represents how much had been paid for cluade to get to that point. 
* Current Releases:
  * release 2.5.0 - Basic Stock Market fuctionality, basic navigation, robust error handling.
    * ~$.80 for the room app.
    * ~$.40 for the room navigation.
    * ~$.20 for the stock market refactor from something I had.
    * The rest is bug fixes for the above
